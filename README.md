How to use the code?
-------------------
1. INPUT: dyn_3Nx3N-bulk.dat and example-dyn_3Nx3N-connection.dat are from the folder "bulk"
2. INPUT: dyn_3Rx3R-device.dat is from the folder "surface"
3. Some things you need to modify in the code: 1> n_atm(number of atom in bulk and connection maxtrices, same); n_atm_dvc (number of atoms in device/surface); zero(positive infinitesimal); omega(around the end of the code: start point; step size and largest value); i(iterative number)
4. Module load numpy.
5. Run it.
