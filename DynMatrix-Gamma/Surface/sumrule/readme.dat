1. INPUT: dyn.dat is fc.dat in last step. 
2. INPUT: FC_3Nx3N-bulk-nint.dat and FC_3Nx3N-cnct_d-nint.dat is for the sumrule step. These two files are from the folder "bulk".
If you have 6L SiC in the surface region, you need to use two files generated by setting start = 1.
3. OUTPUT: dyn_prt_sumrule.dat. This is used in Green's function calculation as "dyn_3Rx3R-device.dat".
