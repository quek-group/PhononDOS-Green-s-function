1. Compile the code readDYN.f90 and run it.
Input: dyn.dat is from QE/dynmat.x ; input.dat
Ouput: fc.dat is output which will be used as the input of next step in the folder "AddAtoms"

Purpose: delete the bottom atoms you don't need. For instance, the H atoms used for passivation. 

2. Go to the folder "AddAtoms" 
Prepare input files and input.dat.
Compile AddSiC2.0.f90 and run it.

Purpose: Reorder the atoms according to z coordinate; add more atoms you need. For example, if you want to include more atoms in the substrate in, you can use this.

3. Go to the folder "sumrule" get output
Prepare input files and input.dat.
Compile PrintDeviceMatrix.f90 and run it.

Purpose: Do sumrule; print out files needed for GF DOS calculations: dyn_prt_sumrule.dat. Rename it as dyn_3Rx3R-device.dat for Greens function DOS code.
