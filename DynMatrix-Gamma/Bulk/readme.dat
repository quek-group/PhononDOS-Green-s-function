1. Generate dyn_3Nx3N-bulk-nint.dat; dyn_3Nx3N-connection-nint.dat. These are used in Green's function code.
2. Generate FC_3Nx3N-bulk-nint.dat; FC_3Nx3N-cnct_d-nint.dat. These are used in "AddAtoms" and "sumrule".
3. Search "nint" in the code and change its value as you need. 
It means in the output dynamical matrix, interatomic interactions of nint nearest SiC layers are included. Be careful about the peridic boundary.
