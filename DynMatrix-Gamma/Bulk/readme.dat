This code, GetIFCforGF.f90, is used to generate dynamical matrix of the substrate and connection matrix. In addition, it generate force constant matrices which are needed in DynMatrix-Gamma/surface/ for add more atoms from the substrate in the surface region (can used to build a dynamical matrix of a thicker slab for the slab model), and for sumrule.

1. Go to the patch/ folder.
2. Prepare input files: input.dat; IFC_sumrule.dat; mass.dat.
1> input.dat: descriptions are in the file. Note: be careful about the last parameter, which determines the new order of atoms in the dynamical matrix. 
2> mass.dat: This is from the .dyn file generated by ph.x
3> IFC_sumrule.dat: generated by modified QE6.3; dynmat.x.

To run:
Prepare all files in the same folder before running the code.

$gfortran -o getifc.x GetIFCforGF.f90
$./getifc.x
